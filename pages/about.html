          Hello and thank you for stopping by! &#128075;
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
          I'm Andrew, a London-based design and strategy expert that has spent the last 10+ years
          designing digital tools and services for organisations in the financial services, life sciences, education, housing, and transportation industries.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
          Currently, I'm a service designer with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/" target="_blank">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</a>. 
          I provide end-to-end research and design expertise to project teams responsible for delivering internal case management and intelligence 
          services. I also lead on the development and governance of the FCA's design system and interaction design toolkit.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
          Prior to joining the FCA, I was a lead user experience designer with the Money and Pensions Service and designed digital tools and services for 
          <a href="https://moneyhelper.org.uk" target="_blank">MoneyHelper</a>. I also worked with Open Targets as a product design & strategy lead 
          and supported the development of open-source digital tools for early stage drug discovery. I have also worked in design and strategy roles for other
          organisations in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, I have delivered lectures and design
          workshops in the UK, Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil, and have also authored content for 
          <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/user-experience-design/" target="_blank">an online design course</a>.
