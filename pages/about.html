            Hello! 
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            My name is Andrew Hercules and I am a multidisciplinary product and service designer with extensive industry experience
            across a range of sectors. And yes, in case you are wondering, my last name really is Hercules!
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Currently, I am the Product Design & Strategy Lead for <a class="external-link" href="http://www.opentargets.org/" target="_blank">Open Targets</a>,
            an innovative, multi-year industry-academia partnership that builds digital tools and services that help research scientists  
            identify and prioritise potential drug targets. As a key member of the
            <a class="external-link" href="https://platform.opentargets.org/" target="_blank">Open Targets Platform</a> product team,
            I lead all user research activities and generate research insights and artefacts, design solutions that respect technical and
            data constraints, and facilitate usability testing sessions. I also build Python scripts to analyse pipeline inputs
            and to generate additional user insights from web analytics. Additionally, I deliver interactive workshops and conference talks
            on various product and service design topics. 
          </p>
          <!-- <p class="page-text">
            Prior to joining the Open Targets team, I worked as a Freelance Product Designer and Digital Strategist for various 
            Canadian and European organisations. I have also worked as a Front-End Developer and UX Designer specialising in publications and data repositories, 
            a product and service design consultant for Deloitte Digital, a communications coordinator and front-end developer for the University of Toronto, 
            a writer/producer/presenter for Radio Netherlands Worldwide, and a freelance writer/producer.
