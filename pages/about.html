          I'm Andrew, a multidisciplinary user experience and service design expert that has designed digital and omnichannel experiences 
          for organisations in various industries, including financial services, banking, insurance, life science research,
          and education.

          Currently, I'm a Lead User Experience Designer for the Money and Pensions Service (MaPS) working on 
          <a href="https://moneyhelper.org.uk" target="_blank">MoneyHelper</a>, a consumer-facing website that brings together a 
          range of free money and pensions guidance and services. I provide end-to-end design expertise to drive the development 
          of new user journeys and digital tools that help people manage their money and improve their financial wellbeing. This includes 
          conducting user research, facilitating participatory design sessions and workshops, sketching wireframes, creating mockups 
          and prototypes, and conducting usability testing. I also work closely with senior stakeholders to ensure solutions adhere to 
          legislative, regulatory, and partnership requirements and meet accessibility and service standards.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
          Prior to joining the MaPS design team, I was the Product Design & Strategy Lead for Open Targets and supported
          the development of open-source digital tools and services that empower researchers to identify and prioritise
          potential drug targets. I have also worked in design and digital strategy roles for various
          organisations in Canada and the United Kingdom. Additionally, I have delivered lectures and
          interactive workshops for conferences in the UK, Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil, and have also contributed
          content for online design courses.
