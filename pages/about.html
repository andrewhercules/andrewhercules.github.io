            Hello! My name is Andrew Hercules and I am a Cambridge-based product designer, data analyst, and digital strategist. 
            And yes, in case you are wondering, my last name really is Hercules!
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Currently, I am the UX lead for <a class="external-link" href="http://www.opentargets.org/" target="_blank">Open Targets</a>,
            an innovative, large-scale, multi-year partnership that brings together expertise from seven complementary institutions 
            to help scientists identify and prioritise potential drug targets. As a key member of the
            <a class="external-link" href="https://www.targetvalidation.org/" target="_blank">Open Targets Platform</a> product team,
            I lead all user research activities, generate and share insights with stakeholders, design solutions that respect technical and
            data constraints, and facilitate usability testing sessions. I also build Python scripts to analyse and visualise data sets,
            API usage data, and web analytics. Additionally, I support efforts to introduce user-centred design to the wider scientific 
            community by presenting interactive workshops throughout Europe. 
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Prior to joining the Open Targets team, I worked as a freelance user experience designer and digital strategist for various 
            Canadian and European organisations. I have also worked as a front-end developer specialising in research and data repositories, 
            a UX and UI consultant for Deloitte Digital, a communications coordinator and front-end developer for the University of Toronto, 
            a writer/producer/presenter for Radio Netherlands Worldwide, and a freelance writer/producer.
