            Hello! My name is Andrew Hercules and I am a Cambridge-based user experience (UX) researcher and designer and
            digital strategist. And yes, in case you are wondering, my last name really is Hercules!
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Currently, I am the UX lead for <a class="external-link" href="http://www.opentargets.org/" target="_blank">Open Targets</a>,
            a unique public-private partnership that integrates vast amounts of genetics and genomics data to help scientists identify
            and prioritise potential therapeutic drug targets. As a key member of the
            <a class="external-link" href="https://www.targetvalidation.org/" target="_blank">OT Platform</a> team,
            I lead all research activities designed to uncover user needs, generate and share insights with stakeholders, design
            solutions that respect technical constraints, and facilitate usability testing sessions to validate research and design work.
            I also support efforts to introduce user research and user-centred design to the wider scientific community by
            facilitating on-campus workshops and training seminars.
          </p>
          <p class="page-text">
            Prior to joining the Open Targets project, I worked as a freelance digital strategist for various Canadian and European
            organisations. I have also worked as a designer/developer specialising in research and data repositories, a UX and UI
            consultant for Deloitte Digital, a communications coordinator for the University of Toronto, a writer/producer/presenter
            for Radio Netherlands Worldwide, and a freelance writer/producer.
