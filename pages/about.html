          Hello!
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
          My name is Andrew Hercules and I am a multidisciplinary product and service designer with extensive industry
          experience across a range of sectors. And yes, in case you are wondering, my last name really is Hercules!
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
          Currently, I am a Lead User Experience Designer at the Money and Pensions Service (MaPS). As a key member of the
          multidisciplinary and cross-functional team assigned to support <a href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en"
            target="_blank">MoneyHelper</a>, I offer full, end-to-end product and service design expertise. This
          includes
          facilitating discovery workshops, conducting qualitative and quantitative user research and competitor
          analyses,
          generating research insights and artefacts, designing low- and high-fidelity solutions that respect technical
          and data
          constraints, and supervising usability testing sessions with external commercial partners.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
          Prior to joining the MaPS design team, I was the Product Design & Strategy Lead for Open Targets and supported
          the development of open-source digital tools and services that empower researchers to identify and prioritise
          potential drug targets. I have also worked product and service design and digital strategy roles for various
          organisations in
          both Canada and the United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text">
          My experience working across multiple industries has given me unique insights and abilities to create bespoke
          user-centred, collaborative, and insights-driven approaches to tackle complex product and service design
          challenges. I have delivered lectures and
          interactive workshops for design conferences in the UK, Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil. Additionally, I have
          also been endorsed by
          Tech Nation as a design expert as part of a successful application for a Global Talent Visa.
