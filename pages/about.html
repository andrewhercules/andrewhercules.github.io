          I'm Andrew, a London-based design and strategy expert. With more than 10 years of experience, I've designed digital and 
          omnichannel tools and services for organisations in the financial services, life sciences, education, housing, and transportation industries.

          Currently, I'm a service designer with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/" target="_blank">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</a>. 
          I provide end-to-end research and design expertise to various project teams and help them create internal tools and 
          services that deliver actionable insights and intelligence for case officers. I'm also leading on the development and governance of the FCA's design system and
          interaction design toolkit.

        <p class="page-text">
          Prior to joining the FCA, I was a lead user experience designer with the Money and Pensions Service and designed digital tools for 
          <a href="https://moneyhelper.org.uk" target="_blank">MoneyHelper</a>. I also worked with Open Targets as a product design & strategy lead 
          and supported the development of open-source digital tools for early stage drug discovery. I have also worked in design and strategy roles for other
          organisations in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, I have delivered lectures and
          workshops in the UK, Switzerland, Spain, and Brazil, and have also authored content for 
          <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/user-experience-design/" target="_blank">an online design course</a>.
