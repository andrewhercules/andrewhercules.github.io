Organisations that provide research funding are increasingly demanding that funding recipients make their research outputs [open-access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access). This requirement has lead to rapid growth in the demand for publications and data repositories.

[EPrints](http://www.eprints.org/uk/) is one of the most popular software packages for building publications repositories. By using various plugins and third-party services, EPrints can also function as a data repository. However, the default user interface of a data repository is the same as the default interface for a publications repository and this causes user confusion and reduces usability. In addition, the default, out-of-the-box interface is not user-friendly and does not meet modern web standards.

Recognising the increasing interest from the University of Londonâ€™s existing and potential customer base, I undertook a short user research project to better understand the needs of users of data repositories. Based on my research insights, I created [low-fidelity wireframes](http://8u3vew.axshare.com) (password: dataset) that demonstrated how "quick-win" changes could resolve many of the issues identified by users. I tested these wireframes with different users and made improvements based on user feedback.  

Using the wireframes as a basis, I redeveloped the default data repository interface using Perl, the EPrints API, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The first repository to get the redesigned interface was [London South Bank University's Data Repository](http://w01.lsbudrtest.da.ulcc.ac.uk). Birkbeck also implemented the redesigned interface for [BiRD](http://researchdata.bbk.ac.uk/) and requested additional features based on their specific requirements (e.g. a navigation menu on an individual dataset record page).
