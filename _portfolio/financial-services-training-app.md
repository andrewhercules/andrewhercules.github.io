In January 2017, an established European financial services and advisory firm reviewed the training programme new hires must complete within two months of joining the company. While 100% of new staff members hired in 2015 completed the training, more than 60% completed it within two weeks of the completion deadline. This presented a unique problem because new staff could not work on new or existing client accounts until the training was complete.

I was asked by the management team to rethink and redesign the new hire training experience. I researched different staff development and training programmes and focused on ones offered on mobile devices. At the time, the company was considering a proposal that would give each staff member a tablet for client work. To increase the value proposition for the tablet proposal, I recommended that the training be tablet-based so that users could have a flexible, tailored, anytime/anywhere experience. To support my recommendation, I created [a high-fidelity mockup](/assets/docs/portfolio/financial-services-training-app/financial_training_mockups.pdf) of a tablet-based training module, various low-fidelity proto-personas, and a high-fidelity persona for the new graduate user.

After creating some initial design artefacts, I wanted to review the existing data on training completion rates. However, after engaging in contextual inquiry and ethnographic research at the company's London office, I discovered that a very complex, manual, and time-intensive process had resulted in missing and incomplete data. As such, the scope of my project shifted away from redesigning the training programme and towards a digital transformation project. I worked with various team leads to create a pilot project that would focus on the processes and tools needed to accurately capture all training-related data. The pilot project was launched with the new graduate hires that started in October 2017 and is still ongoing.
