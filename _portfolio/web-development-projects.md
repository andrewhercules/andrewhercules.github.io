#### [Rewardr](https://github.com/HatStephens/FATS_Rewardr)
##### A corporate rewards platform for small businesses

This is a project that I collaborated on with [Stephen Giles](https://github.com/HatStephens), [Tim Scully](https://github.com/Scully87), and [Fadie Hannona](https://github.com/fadieh). I was responsible for writing back-end Ruby code - specifically for controllers that managed the registration of users and the assigning of rewards - and comprehensive unit and acceptance tests with Rspec and Capybara. The platform was developed with Ruby on Rails, Rspec, Capybara, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/HatStephens/FATS_Rewardr).

#### [Badgr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUN0YaqLpF8&list=UU1NQjRun26caQPa6D6j3dsg)
##### A mobile app allowing users to send badges to their friends

This is another project I collaborated on with [Stephen Giles](https://github.com/HatStephens), [Tim Scully](https://github.com/Scully87), and [Fadie Hannona](https://github.com/fadieh). I was responsible for writing the back-end code and connecting the app with the Parse backend-as-a-service system. The app was built with JavaScript (jQuery), HTML, CSS, Parse (now defunct), and PhoneGap. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Scully87/FATS_badgr).

#### [Pico Pico](https://pico-pico.herokuapp.com/)
##### A basic Twitter-like app allowing users to post short messages

I created the app and wrote the back-end Ruby code, configured the database, and designed and developed the front-end user interface. The app was built with Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewhercules/pico-pico).

#### [Rock Paper Scissors](https://ah-rps.herokuapp.com/)
##### A web version of the classic hand game

I created the app and wrote the game logic using Ruby, configured a Sinatra server, and designed and built the user interface. The app was built with Ruby, Sinatra, Rspec, Cucumber, HTML, and CSS. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewhercules/rock-paper-scissors).

#### [JavaScript Refresher](https://github.com/andrewhercules/javascript-refresher)
##### A repository with simple JavaScript exercises

Back in January 2015, I created a repository of simple JavaScript exercises that I found helpful when re-learning JavaScript. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewhercules/javascript-refresher). Please note: the code is written in ES5 and some of the answers should be refactored and optimised by taking advantage of the features available in ES6+.
