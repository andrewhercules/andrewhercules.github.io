[Bloom](https://bloom.london.ac.uk/about) is a flexible, reliable, and customisable e-learning solution developed by the Software Services team at the University of London (UoL). More than 3 million users at 90+ colleges, universities, and education/training institutions use it to support and enhance their learning experience.

In March 2016, I began working on a project to research and redesign the user experience and user interface. The goal of the project was to create an "out-of-the-box" service offering that meets the needs of all users - from students and lecturers to learning technologists and administrative staff.

I utilised a range of quantitative and qualitative research methods - including competitor analysis, academic literature review, one-to-one interviews, focus groups, and surveys - to better understand how users are currently using Bloom and other virtual learning environments. Alongside my colleagues [Petya Stoyanova](https://petantse.github.io/petya_stoyanova/) and [Flora Bowden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flora-bowden-0a3981a7/), we analysed our research findings, generated actionable insights, and created various research and design artefacts, including:

* [Personas](/assets/docs/portfolio/bloom/bloom_sample_personas.pdf) for student, lecturer, and learning technologist users
* User journeys for both [mobile](/assets/docs/portfolio/bloom/bloom_sample_user_journey_mobile.pdf) and [desktop/laptop](/assets/docs/portfolio/bloom/bloom_sample_user_journey_desktop.pdf) devices
* [Low-fidelity wireframes](/assets/docs/portfolio/bloom/bloom_sample_low_fidelity_dashboard_wireframe.pdf) and [high-fidelity mockups](/assets/docs/portfolio/bloom/bloom_high_fidelity_mockups.pdf) for a redesigned user interface and dashboard

In addition, we also authored a white paper, [Top 5 Research Findings: The Student Experience With Moodle](/assets/docs/portfolio/bloom/bloom_research_whitepaper.pdf) and a [magazine article for Education Technology](/assets/docs/portfolio/bloom/bloom_ed_tech_magazine_article.pdf). We also presented our insights and design artefacts to numerous groups and in December 2016, we were invited by MUGGL (Moodle User Group Greater London) to [present a lecture and Q&A session](/assets/docs/portfolio/bloom/bloom_muggl_meeting_presentation.pdf) during their quarterly meeting.
