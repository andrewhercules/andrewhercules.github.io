Currently, Transport for London (TfL) is undergoing a large-scale and aggressive digital transformation project called TfL IM Mobile. Designed to streamline and improve customer service and operations, the project team is responsible for designing, developing, and deploying a full suite of mobile applications for use on TfL-issued smartphones and tablets.

As one of the User Experience (UX) Designers assigned to the project, I created test scenarios based on existing user journeys and conducted usability testing with various TfL staff. I collected and analysed the feedback and presented it to the larger project group using printed screenshots with colour-coded annotated post-it notes. Using the insights I generated from my research activities, I collaborated with internal stakeholders and external service providers and contractors to redesign and improve the user experience of both the single-sign on and fault reporting applications.

With the single sign-on application, my research resulted in a decision to decouple the need to set password recovery options when a user signs in for the first time. For many users, this process took more than 15 minutes, was frustrating and confusing, and was not optimised for mobile devices. With the fault reporting application, my research findings resulted in numerous UI changes, including a new layout for the profile pop-up box, better use of colour, and a new, more prominent location for the logout button.

My research for both applications, along with supplementary user research, also lead to the creation of [a connectivity status design pattern](/assets/docs/portfolio/tfl-im-mobile/tfl_im_mobile_design_pattern.pdf) notifying users about changes to their connectivity speed. For many users, confusion about their network connection and speed resulted in increased frustration when applications did not work as expected.

For a more information on the development of the design pattern, please download the [TfL IM Mobile Case Study](/assets/docs/portfolio/tfl-im-mobile/tfl_im_mobile_case_study.pdf).
