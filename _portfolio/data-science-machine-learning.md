#### [Date A Scientist](https://github.com/andrewhercules/date-a-scientist)
##### Mining OK Cupid profile data for insights

This is my capstone project for Codecademy's Machine Learning Fundamentals course. Using OK Cupid profile data, I built regression and classification models to predict age and body type responses. I used [a Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/andrewhercules/date-a-scientist/blob/master/date_a_scientist.ipynb) to process, clean, and explore the data, and to build my prediction models. I also created [a PDF presentation](https://github.com/andrewhercules/date-a-scientist/blob/master/date_a_scientist_presentation.pdf) to provide an overview of my process, research questions, and findings. Although my models performed poorly - due to poor feature selection, low correlation between the features, and limited data points after dropping not a number (NaN) values - my project was given [a final score of 18/20](https://github.com/andrewhercules/date-a-scientist/issues/2) and I was awarded [a certificate of completion](https://www.credential.net/ztu3s2xf) for the course.
